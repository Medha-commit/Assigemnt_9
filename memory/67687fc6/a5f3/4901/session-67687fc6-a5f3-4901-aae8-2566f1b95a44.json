It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt.

Nun Expedition 7135 m located in **Ladakh** on the Indian side of the Line of Control, is one of the highest peaks in the Himalayan range. The massif is located near the Suru valley in the Kargil district, east of Srinagar. To the north, the Suru valley and the Zanskar range form a border with the Nun Kun Mountain. The heights of both Nun altitude 7135 m is and Kun 7078 m are almost the same\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn the Kashmir-Zanskar border, Mt. Nun and Kun, as well as Barmal, White Needle, and Pinnacle Peak, form a horseshoe shape over the Suru River. The Mt. Nun trek allows you to bypass the difficult and arduous terrain of Zanskar and the Kargil region of Ladhak. Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m. This trek might also assist climbers in choosing their next expedition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition2.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Key Points of Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness. We strongly advise trekkers to be physically and mentally prepared for an endurance process as the arduous journey throws obstacles at every step and inch. Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls.

Nun Expedition 7135 m located in **Ladakh** on the Indian side of the Line of Control, is one of the highest peaks in the Himalayan range. The massif is located near the Suru valley in the Kargil district, east of Srinagar. To the north, the Suru valley and the Zanskar range form a border with the Nun Kun Mountain. The heights of both Nun altitude 7135 m is and Kun 7078 m are almost the same\\\\n\\\\nOn the Kashmir-Zanskar border, Mt. Nun and Kun, as well as Barmal, White Needle, and Pinnacle Peak, form a horseshoe shape over the Suru River. The Mt. Nun trek allows you to bypass the difficult and arduous terrain of Zanskar and the Kargil region of Ladhak. Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m. This trek might also assist climbers in choosing their next expedition.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition2.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Key Points of Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\n\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\n\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\n\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\n\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\n\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness. We strongly advise trekkers to be physically and mentally prepared for an endurance process as the arduous journey throws obstacles at every step and inch. Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\n\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\n\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls. Winters are highly improbable for this summit expedition.\\\\n\\\\n**Trekking Essentials**\\\\n\\\\n1) Because nights at elevations tend to be considerably colder, we suggest having well-graded, warm and comfortable clothing along with good quality shoes.\\\\n\\\\n2) Despite the fact that we handle medical crises, we urge individuals to keep their emergency kits at hand in any case of personal underlying illnesses.\\\\n\\\\n3) Since the journey provides you with a picturesque view of many peaks, don\u2019t forget to bring your camera along with extra batteries.\\\\n\\\\n4) Our staff will consult with fellow trekkers about their luggage and, if lacking, will assist trekkers in obtaining any necessary equipment.

It consists of two main peaks: **Nun** (7,135 m (23,409 feet)) and **Kun** (7,077 m (23,219 feet)),[4] separated from each other by a 4 km long snowy plateau, with a third peak of the massif, known as Pinnacle Peak (6,930 m (22,740 feet)), lying at its eastern end.[5] Nun is the tallest peak of Jammu and Kashmir, while its sister peak Kun lies in Ladakh. It is about 250 km (160 mi) east of Srinagar. The Nun Kun massif is bounded to the north by the Suru valley and the Zanskar range, flanked to the east by the Pensi La (4400 m), which separates the Suru and Zanskar Valleys, while the Kishtwar National Park and the Krash Nai river lie to its south. The rocks predominantly are stratified sedimentary rocks composed of shale and sandstone. Metamorphic rocks and granite formations are also seen at places.

It consists of two main peaks: **Nun** (7,135 m (23,409 feet)) and **Kun** (7,077 m (23,219 feet)),[4] separated from each other by a 4 km long snowy plateau, with a third peak of the massif, known as Pinnacle Peak (6,930 m (22,740 feet)), lying at its eastern end.[5] Nun is the tallest peak of Jammu and Kashmir, while its sister peak Kun lies in Ladakh. It is about 250 km (160 mi) east of Srinagar. The Nun Kun massif is bounded to the north by the Suru valley and the Zanskar range, flanked to the east by the Pensi La (4400 m), which separates the Suru and Zanskar Valleys, while the Kishtwar National Park and the Krash Nai river lie to its south. The rocks predominantly are stratified sedimentary rocks composed of shale and sandstone. Metamorphic rocks and granite formations are also seen at places. The area is rich in minerals, especially garnets.[6]\\\\n\\\\n## Mountaineering\\\\n\\\\n[edit]**Image:** [Image file not found: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Nun_Kun_massif.jpg/250px-Nun_Kun_massif.jpg]\\\\n\\\\nEarly exploration of the massif included a visit in 1898 and three visits by Arthur Neve, in 1902, 1904, and 1910.
