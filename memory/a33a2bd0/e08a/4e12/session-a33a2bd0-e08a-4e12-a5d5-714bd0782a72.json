Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities.

Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m. This trek might also assist climbers in choosing their next expedition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition2.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Key Points of Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness. We strongly advise trekkers to be physically and mentally prepared for an endurance process as the arduous journey throws obstacles at every step and inch. Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls. Winters are highly improbable for this summit expedition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trekking Essentials**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) Because nights at elevations tend to be considerably colder, we suggest having well-graded, warm and comfortable clothing along with good quality shoes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) Despite the fact that we handle medical crises, we urge individuals to keep their emergency kits at hand in any case of personal underlying illnesses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3) Since the journey provides you with a picturesque view of many peaks, don\u2019t forget to bring your camera along with extra batteries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4) Our staff will consult with fellow trekkers about their luggage and, if lacking, will assist trekkers in obtaining any necessary equipment. Only the relevant luggage should be brought, as a result.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*Other important trekking essentials-*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connectivity and Transactions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) All networks, including Vi, Airtel, and BSNL, function well in Ladhak, but connectivity along the route is unpredictable, so we advise people to complete all of their work ahead of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) Trekkers will be provided with walkie- talkies beforehand in case of emergency\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3)The last ATM transactions available will be at Leh. We recommend travelers to collect cash beforehand or while in Lehas ATM available at other places might not dispense cash at times.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition4.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Things Himalayan hikers recommend**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs previously stated, a camera, as well as spare batteries and memory cards, are recommended. We can assure and guarantee that you will be stopping frequently along the trail to observe the grandeur of the trekking experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe strongly advise trekkers to prepare for the perilous journey ahead. Consistently working on your physical fitness and mental stamina will be of great help to trekkers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the trek, we strongly encourage trekkers to tag us on social media when they post any memories from the trip; this will not only prove invaluable to us with our work, but will also serve as a motivational example for all of our experts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why you should choose us**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\u2019re here to give you the greatest experience possible through the eyes of highly skilled and qualified specialists who have a passion for adventure sports.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\n\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\n\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\n\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\n\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\n\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness. We strongly advise trekkers to be physically and mentally prepared for an endurance process as the arduous journey throws obstacles at every step and inch. Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\n\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\n\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls. Winters are highly improbable for this summit expedition.\\\\n\\\\n**Trekking Essentials**\\\\n\\\\n1) Because nights at elevations tend to be considerably colder, we suggest having well-graded, warm and comfortable clothing along with good quality shoes.\\\\n\\\\n2) Despite the fact that we handle medical crises, we urge individuals to keep their emergency kits at hand in any case of personal underlying illnesses.\\\\n\\\\n3) Since the journey provides you with a picturesque view of many peaks, don\u2019t forget to bring your camera along with extra batteries.\\\\n\\\\n4) Our staff will consult with fellow trekkers about their luggage and, if lacking, will assist trekkers in obtaining any necessary equipment. Only the relevant luggage should be brought, as a result.\\\\n\\\\n*Other important trekking essentials-*\\\\n\\\\n**Connectivity and Transactions**\\\\n\\\\n1) All networks, including Vi, Airtel, and BSNL, function well in Ladhak, but connectivity along the route is unpredictable, so we advise people to complete all of their work ahead of time.\\\\n\\\\n2) Trekkers will be provided with walkie- talkies beforehand in case of emergency\\\\n\\\\n3)The last ATM transactions available will be at Leh.

The massif is located near the Suru valley in the Kargil district, east of Srinagar. To the north, the Suru valley and the Zanskar range form a border with the Nun Kun Mountain. The heights of both Nun altitude 7135 m is and Kun 7078 m are almost the same\\\\n\\\\nOn the Kashmir-Zanskar border, Mt. Nun and Kun, as well as Barmal, White Needle, and Pinnacle Peak, form a horseshoe shape over the Suru River. The Mt. Nun trek allows you to bypass the difficult and arduous terrain of Zanskar and the Kargil region of Ladhak. Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\n\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\n\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\n\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\n\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\n\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness.

Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\n\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\n\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls. Winters are highly improbable for this summit expedition.\\\\n\\\\n**Trekking Essentials**\\\\n\\\\n1) Because nights at elevations tend to be considerably colder, we suggest having well-graded, warm and comfortable clothing along with good quality shoes.\\\\n\\\\n2) Despite the fact that we handle medical crises, we urge individuals to keep their emergency kits at hand in any case of personal underlying illnesses.\\\\n\\\\n3) Since the journey provides you with a picturesque view of many peaks, don\u2019t forget to bring your camera along with extra batteries.\\\\n\\\\n4) Our staff will consult with fellow trekkers about their luggage and, if lacking, will assist trekkers in obtaining any necessary equipment.

Nun Expedition 7135 m located in **Ladakh** on the Indian side of the Line of Control, is one of the highest peaks in the Himalayan range. The massif is located near the Suru valley in the Kargil district, east of Srinagar. To the north, the Suru valley and the Zanskar range form a border with the Nun Kun Mountain. The heights of both Nun altitude 7135 m is and Kun 7078 m are almost the same\\\\n\\\\nOn the Kashmir-Zanskar border, Mt. Nun and Kun, as well as Barmal, White Needle, and Pinnacle Peak, form a horseshoe shape over the Suru River. The Mt. Nun trek allows you to bypass the difficult and arduous terrain of Zanskar and the Kargil region of Ladhak. Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m. This trek might also assist climbers in choosing their next expedition.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition2.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Key Points of Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\n\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\n\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\n\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\n\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\n\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\n\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness. We strongly advise trekkers to be physically and mentally prepared for an endurance process as the arduous journey throws obstacles at every step and inch. Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\n\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\n\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls. Winters are highly improbable for this summit expedition.\\\\n\\\\n**Trekking Essentials**\\\\n\\\\n1) Because nights at elevations tend to be considerably colder, we suggest having well-graded, warm and comfortable clothing along with good quality shoes.\\\\n\\\\n2) Despite the fact that we handle medical crises, we urge individuals to keep their emergency kits at hand in any case of personal underlying illnesses.\\\\n\\\\n3) Since the journey provides you with a picturesque view of many peaks, don\u2019t forget to bring your camera along with extra batteries.\\\\n\\\\n4) Our staff will consult with fellow trekkers about their luggage and, if lacking, will assist trekkers in obtaining any necessary equipment. Only the relevant luggage should be brought, as a result.\\\\n\\\\n*Other important trekking essentials-*\\\\n\\\\n**Connectivity and Transactions**\\\\n\\\\n1) All networks, including Vi, Airtel, and BSNL, function well in Ladhak, but connectivity along the route is unpredictable, so we advise people to complete all of their work ahead of time.\\\\n\\\\n2) Trekkers will be provided with walkie- talkies beforehand in case of emergency\\\\n\\\\n3)The last ATM transactions available will be at Leh. We recommend travelers to collect cash beforehand or while in Lehas ATM available at other places might not dispense cash at times.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition4.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Things Himalayan hikers recommend**\\\\n\\\\nAs previously stated, a camera, as well as spare batteries and memory cards, are recommended. We can assure and guarantee that you will be stopping frequently along the trail to observe the grandeur of the trekking experience.\\\\n\\\\nWe strongly advise trekkers to prepare for the perilous journey ahead. Consistently working on your physical fitness and mental stamina will be of great help to trekkers.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the trek, we strongly encourage trekkers to tag us on social media when they post any memories from the trip; this will not only prove invaluable to us with our work, but will also serve as a motivational example for all of our experts.\\\\n\\\\n**Why you should choose us**\\\\n\\\\nWe\u2019re here to give you the greatest experience possible through the eyes of highly skilled and qualified specialists who have a passion for adventure sports. We are community members attempting to promote our favorite adventure sports while also supporting local businesses.

Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m.

Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\n\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.
