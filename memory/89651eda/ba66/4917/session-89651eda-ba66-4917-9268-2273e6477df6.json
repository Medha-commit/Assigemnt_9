It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league.

There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names. There have been similar battles over foreign trademarks in China \u2013 with the United States information technology company, Apple and the Australian wine-maker, Penfolds.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla\\'s being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla\\'s Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_21]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",
