It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties.

There have also been a number of open source initiatives in respect of individual clean technology projects. More recently, the World Intellectual Property Organization has established WIPO Green to promote the diffusion of green technology. [79] Eric Lane, a Law Professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, considered the strategy of Tesla Motors in the Green Patent Blog. [80] He considered the precedent of the Eco-Patent Commons, and its mixed success. Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very significant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and legal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to operate are always extremely complex.\u2019 [81] He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will be motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and patent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that technology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own R&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be inferior or unproven technologies.\u2019 [82] Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in respect of clean technologies. In their 2010 book MacroWikinomics, Tapscott and Williams 79 WIPO GREEN, https://www3.wipo.int/wipogreen/en/about/ 80 Eric Lane, \u2018Elon Musk Launches the Tesla-Patent Commons\u2019, *The Green Patent Blog*, 14 June 2014, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2014/06/14/elon - musk - launches - the - tesla - patent - commons/ 81 Ibid. 82 Ibid. 23 ----- ## called for the establishment of a green technology commons. [83] The pair recognised: \u2018It is quickly becoming clear that climate change will be the biggest issue that human civilisation has ever had to deal with.\u2019 [84] Tapscott and Williams were concerned about the limitations of existing responses to the problem of climate change. The writers promoted open and collaborative responses to climate change: \u2018Tackling climate change will not only require unprecedented transformations in our systems of commerce and industry, it will also require fundamental changes\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_11]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] ## Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.\u2019 [13] Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u2019 [14] This statement has attracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual property; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address climate change. 10 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 11 Ibid, 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 5 ----- ## This paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual property, open innovation, and climate change. It is worth situating the story in the context of the growing literature on intellectual property and clean technologies. Professor Peter Menell from the University of California, Berkeley, and Sarah Tran reviewed the canon of key articles in the field in Intellectual Property, Innovation, and the Environment . [ 15] Scottish scholar Abbe Brown has edited a number of contemporary papers on intellectual property and climate change. [16] Professor Estelle Derclaye from the University of Nottingham has written widely on intellectual property and climate change in the European Union. [17] Professor Tine Summer from Aarhus University, Denmark, has explored the patenting of environmentally sound technologies.

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker\\\\\\'s wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker\\\\\\'s goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker\\\\\\'s wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours.\\\\n[Source: cricket.txt, ID: cricket_0]\\', annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda\\'s tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

As brought out in the Table above, Wellray has transferred funds amounting to Rs. 39.31 Crore to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters of Gensol. The details of the analysis of the further utilization of funds by the said promotors are given below: ***Utilization of funds by Anmol Singh Jaggi*** ### 68. From the analysis of the bank statements of Anmol Singh Jaggi, it is prima-facie observed that majority of the funds (Rs. 25.76 Crore) as mentioned above, were transferred to other related parties, family members or utilized for personal expenses. The details of further utilisation of funds received from Wellray by Anmol Singh Jaggi are given in the Table below: |Name of The Party|Amount (Rs.)|Remarks| |---|---|---| |Gensol Ventures Pvt.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda\\'s tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

A journey just to catch glimpses of these mysterious, remote, savage giants is the trip of a lifetime for many and, for mountaineers, they\u2019re the ultimate challenge. Rising to way above 8,000m, they stretch through the best part of the Earth\u2019s troposphere, towards the thin air of the stratosphere, reaching heights usually associated with the cruising altitudes of airliners. Up here, conditions are brutal (so your down jackets and winter gloves need to be top-class). The cold is fierce, the oxygen is depleted and nothing survives for very long. All of the tallest mountains in the world are located in Asia, either in the Himalayas or the Karakorum ranges. Of the 10 highest, nine are found in Nepal, including the highest of all: Everest. What is the highest mountain in the world? The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, at 8,849m (29,031ft) above sea level, in the Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalayas. The mountain attracts mountaineers and trekkers from around the globe and, while its easiest routes are technically straightforward by mountaineering standards, its high altitude makes climbing it a hugely dangerous undertaking. It\u2019s known to the Nepalese as Sagarmatha \u2013 loosely translating as \\\\\\'The Head in the Heavens\\\\\\' \u2013 and to the Tibetans as Chomolungma (or Qomolangma) \u2013 loosely meaning \\\\\\'Goddess Mother\\\\\\'. Whatever the exact translations are, the local names are certainly more romantic than \u2018Everest\u2019, the name given to the mountain by the Royal Geographical Society in 1865 in honour of the surveyor George Everest, whose surname is actually pronounced eev-rist. Interestingly, Everest is not the tallest mountain in the world from base to peak. That accolade goes to Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Kea, which rises to 10,210m from bottom to top. So, why isn\u2019t Mauna Kea cited as the highest mountain in the world? Well, around 6,000m of Mauna Kea is underwater, with \\\\\\'only\\\\\\' 4,107m rising above sea level. Then there\u2019s Ecuador\u2019s 6,268m-high Chimborazo, the summit of which, thanks to the Earth\u2019s equatorial bulge, is the highest point from the centre of the planet and therefore the closest mountain to the stars. What are the tallest mountains on each continent? Aconcagua (6,961m), pictured here, is the highest mountain outside of Asia and the highest peak in the Americas \u00a9Almazoff/Shutterstock You may have heard of the Seven Summits, the seven highest peaks on each of the Earth\u2019s separate continents. Many adventurous souls make it their mission to bag each of these special peaks. They are: Asia: Mount Everest (8,849m)South America: Aconcagua (6,962m)North America: Denali (6,194m)Africa: Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m)Europe: Mount Elbrus (5,642m)Antarctica: Vinson Massif (4,892m)Oceania: Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid) (4,884m) Everest is, of course, the highest mountain in Asia and easily the tallest in the Seven Summits list, almost 2,000m higher than its next rival: Aconcagua. Rising above all else in the Andes, Aconcagua is South America\u2019s highest peak. The legendary Denali in Alaska is North America\u2019s loftiest, measuring a whopping 5,500m from valley to summit and reaching a height of 6,194m above sea level. Denali is closely followed by Africa\u2019s iconic Mount Kilimanjaro, a massive dormant volcano and the world\u2019s highest free-standing mountain. Mount Elbrus, another dormant volcano, is Europe\u2019s tallest mountain, located in the Russian Caucasus. The vast, icy, polar desert of Antarctica is crowned by the Vinson Massif, while Oceania\u2019s loftiest point is Puncak Jaya (the Carstensz Pyramid) on New Guinea, the world\u2019s highest island peak. The 10 highest mountains in the world 1. Everest, Himalayas, Nepal Everest, the peak that\\\\\\'s furthest left in this image, is the highest mountain in the world at 8,848m \u00a9Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock Height: 8,849m (29,031ft)First ascent: 29 May 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay The fact that Everest is the highest mountain in the world makes it an irresistible draw to so many. The subject of countless expeditions, daring adventures, stunning films and gripping novels, no other mountain on our planet holds such a fascination with the general public. The stories and names associated with the mountain echo through time: George Mallory, Sandy Irvine, Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Tom Hornbein, Willi Unsoeld, Junko Tabei, Reinhold Messner, Peter Habeler, Joe Taker and Pete Boardman, to name just a few. These days, hundreds achieve the summit every year, most by the two main routes: the South Col Route from Nepal and the Northeast Ridge from Tibet. It\u2019s thought that around 300 people have died attempting to climb the mountain and many bodies remain unrecovered on the mountain. The wider Khumbu region is a hugely popular hiking arena, containing many world class hikes, including the iconic Everest Basecamp trek. 2. K2, Karakorum, Pakistan \u00a9Hussain Warraich/Shutterstock Height: 8,611m (28,251ft)First ascent: 31 July 1954 by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli Cited as the \\\\\\'Savage Mountain\\\\\\' and the \\\\\\'Mountain of Mountains\\\\\\', K2 is the world\u2019s second highest peak and one of its most dangerous. It\u2019s also arguably the most spectacular of them all, an immense, soaring pyramid that calls like a siren to the mountaineering\u2019s elite. Located in Pakistan\u2019s Karakorum range, it\u2019s so remote that the original Western surveyors exploring the region couldn\u2019t find a local name for it. So, they temporarily titled it K2: K for Karakorum and 2 because it was the second prominent peak in a sketch by surveyor Thomas Montgomerie. The name stuck. The Italians claimed the first ascent, via the Abruzzi Spur, in 1954. Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli achieved the summit but it was the efforts of Walter Bonatti and his Hunza companion Amir Mehdi, forced into a controversial bivouac high up in the Death Zone, that have gone down in mountaineering folklore. For many years, the glittering prize of a winter ascent alluded the world\u2019s leading mountaineers until a successful Nepalese expedition, led by Nims Purja, placed 10 climbers on the summit in January 2021. 3. Kanchenjunga, Himalayas, Nepal \u00a9Rounov/Shutterstock Height: 8,586m (28,169ft)First ascent: 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band Kanchenjunga, the world\u2019s 3rd highest mountain, occupies the border between eastern Nepal and India and was once thought to the highest of them all. It\u2019s the only one of the world\u2019s 8,000m summits that the British can claim to have been the first to stand on, although some would point out that Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\u2019s 1953 Everest success was as part of a British expedition. Nevertheless, the first Britons to stand on one of the tallest mountains in the world were Joe Brown and George Band on Kanch (as it\u2019s affectionately known) in 1955. As the mountain is sacred to the Indian Sikkim people, Brown and Band stopped just short of the very summit. 4. Lhotse, Himalayas, Nepal Lhotse is the second-highest peak you can see in this photo, with Mount Everest sitting to it\\\\\\'s right \u00a9Daniel Prudek/Shutterstock Height: 8,516m (27,940ft)First ascent: 18 May 1956 by Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss It could be argued that Lhotse is not a separate mountain, as it\u2019s at the centre of the gargantuan Everest massif, which also contains the prominent Nuptse (7,861m), as well as the tallest mountain in the world. From Everest basecamp, Lhotse rises at the centre of the Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse horseshoe, its stark walls rising high above the Western Cwm. The most popular route that mountaineers take when climbing Everest climbs the Lhotse Face on the way to the South Col, before the brutal push up to the famous summit.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company\\'s $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India\\'s biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF\\'s first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company\\'s growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", annotations=None)] isError=False'}",

Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_18]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'acquired based on traditional knowledge. |S.

It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz.

Nun Expedition 7135 m located in **Ladakh** on the Indian side of the Line of Control, is one of the highest peaks in the Himalayan range. The massif is located near the Suru valley in the Kargil district, east of Srinagar. To the north, the Suru valley and the Zanskar range form a border with the Nun Kun Mountain. The heights of both Nun altitude 7135 m is and Kun 7078 m are almost the same\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn the Kashmir-Zanskar border, Mt. Nun and Kun, as well as Barmal, White Needle, and Pinnacle Peak, form a horseshoe shape over the Suru River. The Mt. Nun trek allows you to bypass the difficult and arduous terrain of Zanskar and the Kargil region of Ladhak. Trekkers will be able to travel in the Leh region before and after the official trek, where they will be able to discover the wonderful Buddhist culture, ancient monasteries, regional cuisine, and historic township. To discover Mt. Nun\u2019s majestic beauty, trek through Hemis National Park, the snow leopard\u2019s domain, and brave the cold desert. This trek is an excellent introduction to rougher peaks at a high altitude of 7000m. This trek might also assist climbers in choosing their next expedition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition2.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Key Points of Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMount Nun\u2019s glacial formations, ice fall slopes, edged cliffs, vast crevassed surfaces, descending ice walls, and unpredictable weather will captivate you. Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt. Nun trek safety are indeed very valid. To assure you we have all the possible probabilities calculated if anything goes off the schedule. At every stop point of the journey, trekkers will be going through a proper guided session informing them about the upcoming terrains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of our professionals strive to provide the best experience possible for trekkers, so a collaborative contribution of a relaxed mindset and morally communicative behavior with fellow trekkers will be greatly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition3.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Difficulty level of Nun Expedition**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause the top is relatively high in elevation, we recommend a reasonable level of physical fitness. We strongly advise trekkers to be physically and mentally prepared for an endurance process as the arduous journey throws obstacles at every step and inch. Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain.

It consists of two main peaks: **Nun** (7,135 m (23,409 feet)) and **Kun** (7,077 m (23,219 feet)),[4] separated from each other by a 4 km long snowy plateau, with a third peak of the massif, known as Pinnacle Peak (6,930 m (22,740 feet)), lying at its eastern end.[5] Nun is the tallest peak of Jammu and Kashmir, while its sister peak Kun lies in Ladakh. It is about 250 km (160 mi) east of Srinagar. The Nun Kun massif is bounded to the north by the Suru valley and the Zanskar range, flanked to the east by the Pensi La (4400 m), which separates the Suru and Zanskar Valleys, while the Kishtwar National Park and the Krash Nai river lie to its south. The rocks predominantly are stratified sedimentary rocks composed of shale and sandstone. Metamorphic rocks and granite formations are also seen at places. The area is rich in minerals, especially garnets.[6]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Mountaineering\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[edit]**Image:** [Image file not found: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Nun_Kun_massif.jpg/250px-Nun_Kun_massif.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEarly exploration of the massif included a visit in 1898 and three visits by Arthur Neve, in 1902, 1904, and 1910. In 1903, Dutch mountaineer H. Sillem investigated the massif and discovered the high plateau between the peaks; he reached an altitude of 6,400 m (21,000 ft) on Nun. In 1906, noted explorer couple Fanny Bullock Workman and her husband William Hunter Workman claimed an ascent of Pinnacle Peak. They also toured extensively through the massif and produced a map; however, controversy surrounded the Workmans\\\\\\' claims, and few trigonometrical points were given for the region, so that the map they produced was not usable.[7]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter unsuccessful attempts to climb the mountain in 1934,[8] 1937, and 1946 the first ascent of Nun was in 1953 by a French-Swiss-Indian-Sherpa team led by Bernard Pierre and Pierre Vittoz, via the west ridge.[9] The summit pair comprised Vittoz, a Moravian missionary to the Tibetans and an experienced alpinist, and Claude Kogan, a pioneering female mountaineer.[10] Since then, other routes have been pioneered.[7][3] The north-west face was first ascended on 27 October and 28, 1976 by seven climbers from a Czech expedition, led by F. \u010cejka.[11] The first British ascent was made by Steve Berry and friends via the east ridge in 1981 (his father had attempted Nun in 1946).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nItalian mountaineer Mario Piacenza made the first ascent of Kun in 1913, via the north-east ridge. Fifty-eight years passed before the second recorded attempt on the peak, which resulted in a successful ascent by an expedition from the Indian Army.\\\\\\\\n[7]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA comprehensive geographic and topographical description along with a history of climbing Mt Nun can be found in the 2018 issue of the Himalayan Journal.[6] on 20 August 2022 IAF operation was held to rescue an Italian mountaineer. The district administration of Kargil deputed a special team to shaped to treat the mountaineer who had suffered acute mountain sickness at a high altitude.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe massif is most conveniently accessed from the road connecting Kargil and Leh. The roadhead from the West is Tangol, approximately a 2 hr drive from Kargil. The route goes through the villages of Sankoo and Panikhar.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe mountain has the North ridge, the longest that splits into North West and North East ridge at around 500m below the summit. the Northwest Ridge splits the Kangriz Glacier into West and East. The South ridge drops from the mountain after 500m giving way to the formidable South wall. The West ridge, is more direct and accessible by climbing the snow wall on the West face. This is reached by traversing the snow field of the Kangriz glacier after climbing the ice wall of the Kangriz Glacier West reached from the base camp (4600m) typically established in the upper Sentik Valley.[6]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## References\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[edit]- ^\\\\\\\\n**a****b**\\\\\\\\\"High Asia I: The Karakoram, Pakistan Himalaya and India Himalaya (north of Nepal)\\\\\\\\\".

There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names. There have been similar battles over foreign trademarks in China \u2013 with the United States information technology company, Apple and the Australian wine-maker, Penfolds.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla\\'s being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla\\'s Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_21]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'date of FY ending, have received performance and career development reviews. 22 Content ----- 10. Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD.

There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims.

Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_18]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'acquired based on traditional knowledge. |S.

[153] ## In August 2014, Tesla Motors finally reached a settlement to end the China trademark dispute. There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names. There have been similar battles over foreign trademarks in China \u2013 with the United States information technology company, Apple and the Australian wine-maker, Penfolds.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla\\'s being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla\\'s Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_21]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'date of FY ending, have received performance and career development reviews. 22 Content ----- 10. Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_18]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'acquired based on traditional knowledge. |S.

[153] ## In August 2014, Tesla Motors finally reached a settlement to end the China trademark dispute. There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names. There have been similar battles over foreign trademarks in China \u2013 with the United States information technology company, Apple and the Australian wine-maker, Penfolds.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019.

Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_18]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'acquired based on traditional knowledge. |S.

There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names. There have been similar battles over foreign trademarks in China \u2013 with the United States information technology company, Apple and the Australian wine-maker, Penfolds.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla\\'s being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla\\'s Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_21]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'date of FY ending, have received performance and career development reviews. 22 Content ----- 10. Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD.

Your trek to Mount Nun will take you through monasteries and ancient Himalayan culture, as well as the cold desert of the Suru Valley.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe expedition to Mt. Nun is only for experienced mountaineers who want to climb peaks of 8000 meters or higher. Prior knowledge of technical and **mountaineering **techniques such as the use of ice axes, roping up procedures, crampons, and jumar climbing is required. Challengers must be physically and mentally fit due to the technical ascent to the summit as well as the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions. This expedition is a training expedition for a number of 8000m peaks. Mt Nun, as one of the most accessible 7000m peaks, provides a remarkable sense of accomplishment while also bringing you one step closer to your expedition aspirations of much higher and harsher peaks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.himalayanhikers.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/nun-expedition6.jpg]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**The altitude covered in Mt.

Nun Trek**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMt. Nun\u2019s ascent and descent are both extremely difficult. The best time to hike these paths is between June and September, when most of the Himalayan region is still in the grip of monsoon season. The temperature usually ranges between -15 and -25 degrees Celsius; the higher the trekkers ascend, the colder it becomes. Trekkers must carry all the necessary backload because the weather over the top is frequently unpredictable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Is it safe?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet amidst the high altitude ranges, concerns regarding Mt.

Throughout the course, all groups will be guided by our experts for trekking equipment and any impending terrain. Trekkers must be aware of any AMC conditions and must notify our teams before continuing their ascent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather conditions in Nun **Expedition\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe weather conditions vary depending on the time of year trekker\u2019s travel. The months of June to September are generally considered to be comfortable for this expedition; however, as the teams gain altitude, the weather may become unpredictable, with heavy snowfalls. Winters are highly improbable for this summit expedition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trekking Essentials**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) Because nights at elevations tend to be considerably colder, we suggest having well-graded, warm and comfortable clothing along with good quality shoes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) Despite the fact that we handle medical crises, we urge individuals to keep their emergency kits at hand in any case of personal underlying illnesses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3) Since the journey provides you with a picturesque view of many peaks, don\u2019t forget to bring your camera along with extra batteries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4) Our staff will consult with fellow trekkers about their luggage and, if lacking, will assist trekkers in obtaining any necessary equipment.

Consistently working on your physical fitness and mental stamina will be of great help to trekkers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the trek, we strongly encourage trekkers to tag us on social media when they post any memories from the trip; this will not only prove invaluable to us with our work, but will also serve as a motivational example for all of our experts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why you should choose us**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\u2019re here to give you the greatest experience possible through the eyes of highly skilled and qualified specialists who have a passion for adventure sports.
